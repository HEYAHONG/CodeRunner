# CodeRunner

An online judge to conduct programming contests or run 24*7 programming site. It was initially born out of the need for organising IIT Roorkee programming competition INSOMNIA. Later development occurred when the need arose for powering the internal programming arena of IIT Roorkee.
In this documentation you will find everything that you need for using it in your local programming competition or for its further development.
